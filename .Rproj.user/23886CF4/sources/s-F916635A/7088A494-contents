# Introduction
## Background

The United Republic of Tanzania (URT)\index{Tanzania} is a coastal state in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO)\index{Western Indian Ocean} region, situated in the eastern part of Africa \index{Africa}, located between \index{Longitude}latitude 1.0$^\circ$S---11$^\circ$S and longitude\index{Latitude} 29.3$^\circ$E---40.15$^\circ$E. The country has a total surface area of 945,040 km^2^, of which 881,000 km^2^ are in Mainland and 2,650 km^2^ are in \index{Zanzibar}Zanzibar [@easternResources]. The country has a coastline of about 1,450 km long stretching from the northern border with Kenya to the southern border with \index{Mozambique}Mozambique [@masalu2008]. Tanzaniaâ€™s marine area includes the extensive internal waters of the Pemba \index{Pemba}, Zanzibar\index{Zanzibar} and Mafia\index{Mafia} channels; a \index{Territorial}Territorial Sea of 64,000 km^2^ and\index{EEZ} an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of about 223,000 km^2^.  

The continental shelf region of Tanzania is characterized by an intensely dynamic pelagic ecosystem. Water column properties are continuously changing due to in-situ biological, chemical and physically mediated processes, regional cycles in solar radiation, prevailing winds, and global-scale effects on ocean circulation. The marine ecosystem in the continental shelf provides a wide range of habitats making for a significant fisheries resources. The fishery sector in Tanzania can broadly be divided into three groups---namely: small-scale artisanal\index{artisanal}, semi-industrial and industrial fisheries\index{fisheries} [@jiddawi2002].

Currently, the coastal fisheries in Tanzania is dominated by artisanal fisheries. The fisheries are concentrated in nearshore waters, and it is being conducted using small vessels and simple fishing gears. In these waters, the most productive fishing grounds are found proximal to the coral reefs, seagrass and mangrove habitats. These areas are in turn experiencing heavy fishing pressure (ASCLME, 2012), which is considered to contribute to the over-exploitation of some of the fish species and degradation of the fish supporting habitats (coral reefs, seagrasses and mangroves) by human activities [@khatib2018].

The second group of the fishery in Tanzania\index{Tanzania} is the semi-industrial\index{Semi-industrial}, which is dominated with small-scale\index{Small scale} fishers and is commercially oriented using a reasonable amount of capital but without traditional involvement [@fishAct]. This fishery is mainly involved in prawn\index{Prawn} fishing using prawn trawlers. Industrial fishing is the third category of fisheries\index{Fishery} and is taking place in the \index{EEZ}Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Industrial EEZ fisheries are exploited mostly by Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFN) vessels. The EEZ fisheries are regulated by the Deep Sea Fishing Authority (DSFA) established in 2010 under the Deep-Sea Fishing Authority Act (DSFA) Act (1998) and its amendments of 2007, recently superseded by the Deep-Sea Fisheries Management & Development Act, 2020.

Fisheries\index{Fisheries} sector has a lot of economic\index{Economic} and social\index{Social} significance in the country. Fishing has historically been a profitable activity, and over the years, has attracted more people. The fisheries sector is among the most important socio-economic resource base in the country (ASCLIME, 2012). Fish serves as a major source of animal protein and contributes 30% of total animal protein intake and serves as essential fats and micro-nutrients (FAO,2007). Fisheries also contribute to foreign exchange earnings and government revenue \index{Revenue}. The fishing industry accounts for about 10% of total exports and 1.71% of the gross \index{Domestic Product}domestic product (GDP) for Mainland and 4.8% for Zanzibar (URT, 2018).

Tanzania EEZ lies within the richest tuna belt of the South-West Indian ocean \index{Semba}[@semba2021Tuna]. Its fishery is mostly done by DWFN which are dominated by EU fleets from French and Spanish and Asian longline fleets (mainly from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and China). Their main gear used are longlines and purse-seines, respectively. The artisanal fishers play an important role in the fishing industry. The contribution of artisanal fishers is estimated to be more than 80% of catches and that, artisanal fishers fishing tuna with tuna fleets consisting of small fishing units.

Despite of having more than two decades of oceanographic research on coast and marine waters of Tanzania and notable progress in understanding regional dynamics [@nansen], broad-scale distributional features are still poorly known. This reflect the dedicated survey program for the systematic collection and dissemination of regional hydrographic data such as the second International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2) of 2017 and 2018, the RV METEOR cruise in the continental margin East Africa\index{Africa} in 2008, the RV Algoa\index{Algoa} cruise in the coastal\index{Coastal} water of Tanzania\index{Tanzania} in 2004 and the RV Dr.Fridtj of Nansen in the Western Indian Ocean\index{Western Indian Ocean}. The published information which does exist is limited [@nansen]\index{Nansen}.  

## Objectives

This aimed to deliver best practices in coastal resource management along the northern coast of Tanzania\index{Tanzania}. The main objective of this study was to contributes to achieving effective long-term ecosystem management in the Western Indian Ocean\index{Western Indian Ocean} Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs). This core objective was achieved through four specific objectives:

i.	Analyse and synthesize oceanographic\index{Oceanographic} data from previous cruises (Agulhas II cruise data).
i.	Undertake four field campaigns each during the NE and SE monsoon periods on the critical habitats of the seascape between Tanzania Mainland\index{Mainland} and the Zanzibar\index{Zanzibar} islands.
i.	peer reviewed scientific publications on mainstreaming of oceanographic data in management
i.	Policy brief on mainstreaming of oceanographic data.

The findings of this research were intended to be shared to community to support in policy harmonization and management reforms towards improved ocean governance. The findings also contributes to evidenced based decision-making processes for sustainable resources management.
