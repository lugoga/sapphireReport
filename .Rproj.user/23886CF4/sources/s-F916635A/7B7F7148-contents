# Executive Summary {-}

The need for use of oceanographic\index{Oceanographic} data to manage the marine resources is very clear. However, in the case of Tanzania the source of such data has always been a big challenge. As a contribution to solving this problem, the Institute of Marine Sciences, Tanzania secured funding under SAPPHIRE Project to conduct oceanographic surveys in the Pemba channel\index{Pemba Channel} and compile existing data from the Republic of South African\index{South Africa} Cruises, mainly Agulhas II (2017 and 2018)\index{Agulhas} that were made in the Tanzanian waters and set up the initial data base and make it readily accessible. 

Through exploration of the oceanographic parameters, IMS was also expected to establish the oceanographic parameters influencing the timing and location of the spawning of tuna and tuna-like species in the Tanzania\index{Tanzania} Northern waters forming a demonstration project under SAPPHIRE. At the end of the two activities, two followup activities were carried out which was to conduct a workshop to share information with fishermen on the oceanographic conditions of the Pemba Channel and publication of the findings through policy briefs and peer review publications. 

As a major recommendation on oceanographic data in Tanzania, scientists carrying out oceanographic work in the Tanzanian waters should be encouraged to supply their data to a database such as the National Oceanographic Data Centre housed at the Institute of Marine Sciences\index{Institute of Marine Sciences} of the University of Dar es Salaam\index{University of Dar es Salaam}. From the data that were collected from the previous cruises and the field campaigns, it can be said that the temperature\index{Temperature}, dissolved oxygen\index{Oxygen}, and nutrients \index{Nutrient} levels in the study area are supportive for tuna fishery.

It would have been difficult for us to conduct this research without the support of large number of people and institutions. The UN Environment \index{UNEP} is highly acknowledged for funding this research through the project entitled “The Western Indian Ocean Large Marine Ecosystems Strategic Action Programme Policy Harmonisation and Institutional Reforms (WIO LME SAPPHIRE).” The SAPPHIRE\index{SAPPHIRE} project is implemented by UNDP\index{UNDP} and executed by the Nairobi Convention\index{Nairobi Convention} Secretariat with the funding from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF)\index{GEF}.
